# garch-vix

### Summary

Modelling S&amp;P500 volatility with GARCH, GJR-GARCH, Beta-t-EGARCH, 2-Beta-t-EGARCH and comparison with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). We generate predictions using historical data and compare how well the different models did in comparison with each other. Mincer-Zarnowitz regression and Diebold-Mariano tests are used for evaluation. There were no sigificant difference between the four GARCH models using Mincer-Zarnowitz regressions (none were unbiased and efficient). Beta-t-EGARCH performs better for some loss functions, but none of the models significantly outperform the VIX using the Diebold-Mariano test.
